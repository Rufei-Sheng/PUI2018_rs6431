## Suggestions:
- Maybe you would like to add more comments in your code for peer review. Besides, the comments can also remind you the function of code and help others understand it.

## Suggested statistical test method: Z-test
- This hypothesis divided the sample into two groups based on people's birth year. After data cleaning, we have two groups of data on the number of people riding citi-bikes. The hypothesis, in other words, is to compare the mean of these two groups of citi-bike rider number. We always use Z-test to compare the mean of two sample.
- _$Z$_=$\frac{(\overline{X}_{\mathrm{1}}-\overline{X}_{\mathrm{2}})-(\mu_{\mathrm{1}}-\mu_{\mathrm{2}})}{\sqrt{\sigma_{\mathrm{1}}^2/{N_{\mathrm{1}}+\sigma_{\mathrm{2}}^2/{N_{\mathrm{2}}} }}\quad} $
- $\mu_{\mathrm{1}}-\mu_{\mathrm{2}}$:  $N_1 - N_2$ in the hypothesis

## Suggested variations
- If you would like to develope your research in the next step, I recommend you try more complicated variables other than the bivariate which only have two results(either born before 1980 or after 1980).
