# Assignment 12:

### Assignment 1.
This assignment aims at practicing the time series analysis to see whether it has periodicity using Fourier Transforms. I done this homework by myself. Using [1:] in both x and f are important to filter out the infinite number. I took sometimes in thinking about how to filter the top4 stations that have the most prominent pattern. Finally I use the original graph to locate the original minimum cut-off value, than iterate the f value over it.


### Assignment 2.
This assignment aims at practicing the clustering methods. Cluster zipcodes based on the economic development (business counts) in time for 1994-2014. I done this homeworks by myself. I practiced K-means clustering, agglomerative clustering, and hierarchical clustering in this assignment, they gave me roughly the same results.
