## Assignment 1:

Assignment 1 is designed for evaluating peer's plot. I reviwed the plot for Samuel Manzi and Linda Jaber, their plots are really great and I learned a lot from them.

## Assignment 2:

I done this assignment by myself. This assignment is designed for exercising the linear regression using statsmodels. I encountered some problems when doing the wls model, while got the idea from assignment 3 latter.


## Assignment 3: investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP

The most part of the assignment is done by myself, while thank you for Borong Lv, who help me with my data accessing; and Junjie Cai, who help me when graphing in the 'modeling' part. This assignment is designed for investigating linear relationship from real-life data (fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP). It is interested to plot different style with beautiful colors.
