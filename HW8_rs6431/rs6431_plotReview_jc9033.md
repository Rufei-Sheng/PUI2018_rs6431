Figure 1:  'Times Square Food & Beverage Locations' data is provided by Times Square Alliance (TSA), which indicates each specific shop with subindustry and location. This figure mainly plot their geolocation with subindustry. The number of shop which provided full service seems to be the largest amount, and the shop provided quick service tend to be at the edge of the square. In order to show the graph clearly, the contour map is filtered into the area in which time-square located.

# Review:

Rufei has a good idea to study the POI (point of interest) data of Time-square. The plot is clear without confusing. And the quantities being visualized properly. At the same time, the graphical elements used appropriately to represent the quantities being visualized. The plot honestly reproducing the data.

But the area of study is too small in the plot while there is much empty space. I would suggest zoom in the area of study so that the points will much bigger and clear and allow us to focus on the topic.

Meanwhile, without the base map, readers are hard to figure out specifically what certain the street is. Actually, the base map is necessary for this map graph.

In view of color, upper points shield bottom points. I will be much better to plot the points with Transparency.

Fourthly, there does not seem to be any obvious pattern in the plot. I suggest conducting nuclear density analysis and plot a thermodynamic chart to study the distribution pattern of the classified commercial service stores.
